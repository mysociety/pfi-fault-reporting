    <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">In Imaginary Trust properties, room numbers are on the front of the entrance doors to a room. </p>
    
    <p>They are usually round and black, with white numbers or yellow rectangles with a black numbers.</p>
    <p>A room number will look something like:</p>
    <p><code>01224</code></p>
