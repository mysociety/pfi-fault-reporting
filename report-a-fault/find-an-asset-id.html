    <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">In Imaginary Trust properties, asset tags are red with white writing, a bar code and are approximately 2 inches long.</p>
    
    <p>An asset tag number will look something like: </p>
    <p><code>ABC123131</code></p>

    <p>Asset identifiers (IDs) help our maintenance teams keep track of equipment around the hospitals, known generally as assets. Anything that could be considered an asset will have an asset tag on it, with a unique number, known as an Asset ID.</p>
    <p>Including an asset ID in a fault report means thereâ€™s a better chance of it being found and fixed quickly.</p>
